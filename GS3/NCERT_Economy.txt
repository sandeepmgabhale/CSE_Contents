-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-1 INDIAN ECONOMY ON THE EVE OF INDEPENDENCE		-----------------------------

	"India is the pivot of our Empire... If the Empire loses any other part of its
	Dominion we can survive, but if we lose India, the sun of our Empire will have
	set."
		- Victor Alexander Vruce, the Viceroy of British India in 1894
		
# LOW LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE COLONIAL RULE
	- Agriculture was the main source of livelihood, besides that handicraft industries in the field of cotton and silk, metal and 
		precious stone.
	
# AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
	- Stagnation in agriculture was caused mainly because of various system of land settlement introduced by colonial government.
		Zamindari system where the zamindars where interested only collecting the rent, no interest in the improvement of agricultural conditions.
	- Low levels of technology, lack of lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilisers, all added up to aggravate
		the plight of the farmers and contributed to the dismal level of agricultural productivity. Commercialization of agriculture 
		producing the cash crops which were to be ultimately used by Britisher back home.
	
# INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
	- The Britisher's intention was, first, to reduce India to the status of a mere exporter of important raw materials for the upcoming modern industries 
		in Britain and, second, to turn India into a sprawling market for the finished products of those industries.
	- Furthermore, the growth rate of the new industrial sector and its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remained very small.

# FOREIGN TRADE
	- Britain maintained a monopoly control over India’s exports and imports. As a result, more than half of India’s foreign trade was restricted to 
		Britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like China, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Persia (Iran).
	- The most important characteristic of India’s foreign trade throughout the colonial period was the generation of a large export surplus. But this
		surplus came at a huge cost to the country’s economy. Several essential commodities—food grains, clothes, kerosene etc. — became conspicuous
		by their acute scarcity in the domestic market.
	- This export surplus did not result in any flow of gold or silver into India. Rather, this was used to make payments for the expenses incurred by an
		office set up by the colonial government in Britain, expenses on war, again fought by the British government, and the import of invisible items, 
		all of which led to the drain of Indian wealth.

# DEMOGRAPHIC CONDITION
	- Public health facilities were either unavailable to large chunks of population or, when available, were highly inadequate. water and air-borne 
		diseases were rampant and took a huge toll on life. 
	- No wonder, the overall mortality rate was very high and in that particularly, the infant mortality rate was quite alarming. Life expectancy was 
		also very low—32 years in contrast to the present 63 years.
	- In the absence of reliable data, it is difficult to specify the extent of poverty at that time but there is no doubt that extensive poverty
		prevailed in India during the colonial period which contributed to the worsening profile of India’s population of the time.
	
# OCCUPATIONAL STRUCTURE
	- Parts of the then Madras Presidency Maharashtra and West Bengal witnessed a decline in the dependence of the workforce on the agricultural sector 
		with a commensurate increase in the manufacturing and the services sectors. 
	- However, there had been an increase in the share of workforce in agriculture during the same time in states such as Orissa, Rajasthan and Punjab.

# INFRASTRUCTURE
	- The real motive behind this development was not to provide basic amenities to the people but to sub-serve various colonial interests.
	- The roads that were built primarily served the purposes of  mobilising the army within India and drawing out raw materials from the countryside to
		the nearest railway station or the port to send these to far away England or other lucrative foreign destinations.
	- the colonial dispensation also took measures for developing the inland trade and sea lanes.
	
# CONCLUSION
	- The agricultural sector was already saddled with surplus labour and extremely low productivity. The industrial sector was crying for modernisation,
		diversification, capacity building and increased public investment.
	- In a nutshell, the social and economic challenges before the country were enormous.
	
# RECAP
	- An understanding of the economy before independence is necessary to know and appreciate the level of development achieved during the 
		post-independence period.
	- Under the colonial dispensation, the economic policies of the government were concerned more with the protection and promotion of British
		economic interests than with the need to develop the economic condition of the colonised country and its people.
	- The agricultural sector continued to experience stagnation and incremental deterioration despite the fact that the largest section of Indian
		population depended on it for sustenance.
	- Systematic policies pursued by the British-India government led to the collapse of India’s world famous handicraft industries without
		contributing, in any significant manner, to its replacement by a modern industrial base.
	- Lack of adequate public health facilities, occurrence of frequent natural calamities and famines pauperised the hapless Indian people and 
		resulted in engendering high mortality rates.
	- Some efforts were made by the colonial regime to improve infrastructure facilities but these efforts were spiced with selfish motives though, in 
		the long run, the independent Indian government built on this base the country’s future economic and social development plan.
	
	

-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-2 INDIAN ECONOMY 1950-1990		-----------------------------
	
		"The central objective of Planning in India... is to initiate a process of
		development which will raise the living standards and open out to the people
		new opportunities for a richer and more varied life."
					- First Five Year Plan
					
# INTRODUCTION
	- Among the thinkers contribution to the five-year plans, the statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was the architect 
		of Indian Planning.	
	- The leaders of independent India had to decide, among other things, the type of economic system most suitable for our nation, a system which would
		promote the welfare of all rather than a few.
	- It is not possible in a democracy like India for the government to change the ownership pattern of land and other properties of its citizens in the 
		way that it was done in the former Soviet Union.	
					

# THE GOALS OF FIVE YEAR PLANS
	- Goals of five year plans are Growth, Modernisation, self-reliance, Equity. It is not that all the plans have given importance 
		to all these goals. Due to limitation of resources choice were made in each plan to which of the goal be given primary importance.
	- Growth: 
	- to increase in the country’s capacity to produce the output of goods and services within the country
	- steady increase in GDP is the good indicator of economic growth
	- GDP is the market value of all the goods and services produced in the country during a year
	- The GDP of a country is derived from the different sector’s of the economy, namely the agricultural sector, the
		industrial sector and the service sector
	- Modernisation: 
	- To increase the production of goods and services the producers have to adopt new technology
	- modernisation does not refer only to the use of new technology but also to changes in social outlook such as the recognition
		that women should have the same rights as men
	- Self-reliance: 
	- A nation can promote economic growth and modernisation by using its own resources or by using resources imported from other 
		nations
	- first seven five-year plans used self-reliance by avoiding imports of those goods and services which could be produced in
		India
	- it was necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign countries, especially for food. This steps were taken out of fear that 
		dependence on imported food supplies, foreign technology and foreign capital may make India's sovereignty vulnerable to 
		foreign interference in our policies
	- Equity:
	- It is important to ensure that the benefits of economic prosperity reach the poor sections as well instead of being enjoyed 
		only by the rich
	- So, in addition to growth, modernisation and self-reliance, equity is also important: every Indian should be able to meet his 
		or her basic needs such as food, a decent house, education and health care and inequality in the distribution of wealth
		should be reduced
	
# AGRICULTURE
	- Land Reforms:
	- to reduce the Zamindari and improve the agriculture productivity
	- ownership of land would give incentives to the tillers to invest in making improvements provided sufficient capital was made
		available to them
	- Land reforms were successful in Kerala and West Bengal because these states had governments committed to the policy of land to 
		the tiller. Unfortunately other states did not have the same level of commitment and vast inequality in landholding
	- Land Ceiling: 
	- fixing the maximum size of land which could be owned by an individual. The purpose of land ceiling was to reduce the 
		concentration of land ownership in a few hands.
	- the goal of equity was not fully served by abolition of intermediaries
	- The land ceiling legislation also faced hurdles due lots of loop holes which exploited by the big landholders to retain
		their land.
	- The Green Revolution: 
	- Productivity in the agricultural sector was very low because of the use of old technology and the absence of required infrastructure
		for the vast majority of farmers
	- India’s agriculture vitally depends on the monsoon and shortfall of monsoon leads to access the irrigation facilities which very
		few farmers had
	- The stagnation in agriculture, which was in the colonial period, was ridden off due to the large increase in production of food grains
		resulting from the use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds especially for wheat and rice
	- the HYV technology spread to a larger number of states and benefited more variety of crops. The spread of green revolution technology 
		enabled India to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains;
	- reducing/removing the dependency on America or other nations for meeting our nation’s food requirements
	- the government provided loans at a low interest rate to small farmers and subsidised fertilisers so that small farmers could also have
		access to the needed inputs
	- The risk of the small farmers being ruined when pests attack their crops was considerably reduced by the services rendered by research 
		institutes established by the government
	- Debate our Subsidies:
	- It was decided that subsidies should be given to the farmers to test and implement new technology for farming like HYV (High yielding 
		variety), as new technology is risky
	- to encourage farmers subsidies to be given and once the technology is found profitably and widely adopted the subsidies to be phased out
	- Otherwise, still continuing subsidies will be burden on government as it does not benefit the target group
	- if subsidies are largely benefiting the fertiliser industry and big farmers, the correct policy is not to abolish subsidies but to take
		steps to ensure that only the poor farmers enjoy the benefits
	- Economists found that between 1950-1990 the GDP contribution by agriculture decline significantly but not the population depending on it
	- the industrial sector and the service sector did not absorb the people working in the agricultural sector, this an important failure of 
		our policies followed during 1950-1990.
		
# INDUSTRY AND TRADE
	- Economists have found that poor nation can progress only if they have good industrial sector, as it provides stable employment than
		agriculture.
	- Industrial sector promote modernisation and overall prosperity. Thus, five-year plans place more emphasis on the industrial development.
	- Market and State in Indian Industrial Development: The state would have complete control of those industries that were vital for
		the economy.
	- Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 (IPR 1956): This policy was categorized in 3 sections, and it was encourage for promoting industry in 
		backward regions and gives easier way for licensing, giving certain concessions like tax benefits and electricity at lower tariff.
	- Small scale Industry: for promoting rural development, also given concessions such as lower excise duty and bank loans at lower
		interest rates.
# TRADE POLICY: IMPORT SUBSTITUTION
	- Instead of importing the vehicles from foreign countries, it was encourage to produce them in India itself and protect the domestic firm 
		from competing the foreign firms.
	- Tariffs are a tax on imported goods; they make imported goods more expensive and discourage their use. Quotas specify the quantity of goods
		which can be imported.
	- The rise in the industry’s share of GDP is an important indicator of development. No more the industrial sector was restricted to only textile
		and jute. It was well diversified, largely due to public sector.
	- scholars point out that the public sector is not meant for earning profits but to promote the welfare of the nation
	- One of the major drawbacks in the industrial sector was the inefficient functioning of the public sector as it started incurring losses leading
		to drain on the nation’s limited resources.
		
# CONCLUSION
	- India became self- sufficient in food production thanks to the green revolution. Land reforms resulted in abolition of the hated zamindari
		system. 
	- many economists became dissatisfied with the performance of many public sector enterprises.
	- Excessive government regulation prevented growth of entrepreneurship.
	
# RECAP
	- After independence, India envisaged an economic system which combines the best features of socialism and capitalism—this culminated in the mixed
		economy model.
	- All the economic planning has been formulated through five year plans.
	- Common goals of five year plans are growth, modernisation, self-sufficiency and equity.
	- The major policy initiatives in agriculture sector were land reforms and green revolution. These initiatives helped India to become self-sufficient
		in food grains production.
	- The proportion of people depending on agriculture did not decline as expected.
	- Policy initiatives in the industrial sector raised its contribution to GDP.
	- One of the major drawbacks in the industrial sector was the inefficient functioning of the public sector as it started incurring losses leading to
		drain on the nation’s limited resources.

	
-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-3 LIBERALISATION PRIVATISATION AND GLOBALISATION		-----------------------------

		"There is a consensus in the world today that economic development is not all
		and the GDP is not necessarily a measure of progress of a society."
			- K.R. Narayanan
			
# This chapter talks about the financial crisis that occurred in 1991.

# INTRODUCTION
	- since independence, India followed the mixed economy framework by combining the advantages of the market economic system with those of the planned
		economic system.

# BACKGROUND
	- The bad economic management leads to crisis, even the foreign reserves were consumed.
	- imports were increased and more than the export, so India recieved loan from World Bank and IMF.
	- In return the foreign investors asked to remove the restriction on trade and private sector to reduce less involvement of Government
		in the private business. To which India agreed and announced the New Economic Policy (NEP).
	- there was a need to maintain sufficient foreign exchange reserves and keep the rising prices under control.
	- aimed at improving the efficiency of the economy and increasing its international competitiveness by removing the rigidities in various
		segments of the Indian economy.
		
# LIBERALISATION
	- introduced to put an end to these restrictions and open up various sectors of the economy.
	- Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all but product categories — alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals industrial explosives, 
		electronics, aerospace and drugs and pharmaceuticals.
	- reserved for the public sector are defence equipments, atomic energy generation and railway transport.
	- Financial reforms for Indian and foreign banks, FII allowed to invest in Indian financial markets.
	- Tax reforms consists of Direct and Indirect taxes.
	- direct taxes on incomes of individuals as well as profits of business enterprises.
	- indirect taxes levied on commodities, in order to facilitate the establishment of a common national market for goods and commodities.
	- Foreign Exchange Reforms as an immediate measure to resolve the balance of payments crisis, the rupee was devalued against foreign
		currencies.
	- Trade and Investment Policy Reforms: aim was also to promote the efficiency of the local industries and the adoption of modern
		technologies.
	- Export duties have been removed to increase the competitive position of Indian goods in the international markets.
	
# PRIVATISATION
	- to improve financial discipline and facilitate modernisation.
	- private capital and managerial capabilities could be effectively utilised to improve the performance of the PSUs.
	
# GLOBALISATION
	- Globalisation is the outcome of the policies of liberalisation and privatisation.
	- It is integration of the economy of the country with the world economy, outcome of the set of various policies that are aimed
		at transforming the world towards greater interdependence and integration.
	- It involves creation of networks and activities transcending economic, social and geographical boundaries.
	- Outsourcing is part of globalisation, low wage rates and availability of skilled man power in India able to bagged outsourcing from
		foreign MNCs.
	- The World Trade Organization (WTO) was founded in 1995 as the successor organisation to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT).

# INDIAN ECONOMY DURING REFORMS: AN ASSESSMENT
	- there has been an increase in the overall GDP growth in the reform period.
	- During the reform period, the growth of agriculture and industrial sectors has declined whereas the growth of service sector has gone up.
		This indicates that the growth is mainly driven by the growth in the service sector.
	- India is seen as a successful exporter of auto parts, engineering goods, IT software and textiles in the reform period.
	- the reform process has been widely criticised for not being able to address some of the basic problems facing our economy especially
		in the areas of employment, agriculture, industry, infrastructure development and fiscal management.
	- Though the GDP growth rate has increased in the reform period, scholars point out that the reform-led growth has not generated sufficient
		employment.
	- Reforms in Agriculture: reduced the growth rate, because the Public investment is reduced in agriculture sector like irrigation, research, etc.
		Also removal of fertiliser subsidy has led to increase in the cost of production.
	- Reforms in Industry: developing countries are compelled to open up their economies to greater flow of goods and capital from developed countries
		and rendering their industries vulnerable to imported goods.
	- a developing country like India still does not have the access to developed countries’ markets because of high non-tariff barriers.
	- Disinvestment as per Critics, the assets of PSUs has been undervalued and sold to private sector. There has been substantial loss to the 
		government.
	- Reforms and Fiscal Policies: The tax reductions aimed at yielding larger revenue which didn't succeed. Also the tax incentives were provided
		foreign investors which further reduced the scope for raising tax revenues.
		
# CONCLUSION
	- the critics argue that globalisation is a strategy of the developed countries to expand their markets in other countries.
	- the crisis that erupted in the early 1990s was basically an outcome of the deep-rooted inequalities in Indian society and the economic 
		reform policies initiated as a response to the crisis by the government.
	- it has increased the income and quality of consumption of only high-income groups and the growth has been concentrated only in some select areas
		in the services sector rather than vital sectors such as agriculture and industry which provide livelihoods to millions of people in the country.
		
# RECAP 
	- The economy was facing problems of declining foreign exchange, growing imports without matching rise in exports and high inflation. India changed
		its economic policies in 1991 due to a financial crisis and pressure from international organisations like the World Bank and IMF.
	- In the domestic economy, major reforms were undertaken in the industrial and financial sectors. Major external sector reforms included foreign
		exchange deregulations and import liberalisation.
	- With a view to improving the performance of the public sector, there was a consensus on reducing its role and opening it up to the private sector. 
		This was done through disinvestment and liberalisation measures.
	- Globalisation is the outcome of the policies of liberalisation and privatisation. It means an integration of the economy of the country with the 
		world economy.
	- Outsourcing is an emerging business activity.
	- The objective of the WTO is to establish a rule based trade regime to ensure optimum utilisation of world resources.
	- During the reforms, growth of agriculture and industry has gone down but the service sector has registered growth.
	- Reforms have not benefited the agriculture sector. There has also been a decline in public investment in this sector.
	- Industrial sector growth has slowed down due to availability of cheaper imports and lower investment.


-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-4 POVERTY		-----------------------------

		"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater
		part of the members are poor and miserable."
				- Adam Smith

# This chapter talks about some of the most challenging issues facing India today are poverty, development of rural India and building 
	infrastructure.
	
# INTRODUCTION
	- Providing minimum basic needs to the people and reduction of poverty have been the major aims of independent India.
	- the successive five year plans envisaged laid emphasis on the upliftment of the poorest of the poor (Antyodaya), integrating the
		poor into the mainstream and achieving a minimum standard of living for all.
	- So poverty is a call to action — for the poor and the wealthy alike — a call to change the world so that many more may have enough to
		eat, adequate shelter, access to education and health, protection from violence, and a voice in what happens in their communities.
		
# WHO ARE THE POOR?
	- Starvation and hunger are the key features of the poorest households. The poor lack basic literacy and skills and hence have very limited 
		economic opportunities. 
	- Poor people also face unstable employment, they are highly vulnerable. A large section of poor people do not even have access to safe 
		drinking water. 
	- Extreme gender inequality in the participation of gainful employment, education and in decision-making within the family.
	- The urban poor are largely the overflow of the rural poor who had migrated to urban areas in search of alternative employment and livelihood, 
		labourers who do a variety of casual jobs and the self-employed who sell a variety of things on roadsides and are engaged in various activities.
	
# HOW ARE POOR PEOPLE IDENTIFIED?
	- there is need to develop a scale to measure poverty, and the factors that make up the criteria for this measurement or mechanism need
		to be carefully chosen.
	- For the purpose of defining poverty we divide people into two categories; the poor and the non-poor and the poverty line separates the
		two. So there are different kinds of poor and non-poor.
	- There are many factors, other than income and assets, which are associated with poverty; for instance, the accessibility to basic education,
		health care, drinking water and sanitation.
	- The aim of poverty alleviation schemes should be to improve human lives by expanding the range of things that a person could be and could do,
		such as to be healthy and well-nourished, to be knowledgeable and participate in the life of a community.	
	- development is about removing the obstacles to the things that a person can do in life, such as illiteracy, ill health,
		lack of access to resources, or lack of civil and political freedoms.

# THE NUMBER OF POOR IN INDIA
	- In 1990s, the absolute number of poor in rural areas had declined whereas the number of their urban counterparts increased marginally.
	- The poverty ratio declined continuously for both urban and rural areas, but declined slowly.

# WHAT CAUSES POVERTY?
	- individual circumstances and/or characteristics of poor people like examples are low levels of education and skills, infirmity, ill
		health, sickness, discrimination.
	- Poverty is also explained by general, economy-wide problems, such as low capital formation, lack of infrastructure, lack of demand, pressure
		of population, lack of social/welfare nets.
	- The urban poor in India are largely the overflow of the rural poor who migrate to urban areas in search of employment and a livelihood. 
		Industrialisation has not been able to absorb all these people.
	- Most of the urban poor are either unemployed or intermittently employed as casual labourers. Casual labours are more vulnerable in the 
		society as they have no job security, no assets, limited skills, sparse opportunities and no surplus to sustain them.
	- Poverty is, therefore, also closely related to nature of employment. Unemployment or under employment and the casual and intermittent nature
		of work in both rural and urban areas that compels indebtedness, in turn, reinforces poverty.
	- The unequal distribution of income and assets has also led to the persistence of poverty in India.
	
# POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES TOWARDS POVERTY ALLEVIATION
	- To quote the First Five Year Plan (1951-56), "the urge to bring economic and social change under present conditions comes from the fact of poverty
		and inequalities in income, wealth and opportunity".
	- The Second Five Year Plan (1956-61) also pointed out that "the benefits of economic development must accrue more and more to the relatively less
		privileged classes of society".
	- Examples of self employment programmes are Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP), Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY) and Swarna
		Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY). The first programme aims at creating self employment opportunities in rural areas and small towns.
	- The educated unemployed from low income families in rural and urban areas can get financial help to set up any kind of enterprise that generates
		employment under PMRY. SJSRY mainly aims at creating employment opportunities both self-employment and wage employment in urban areas.
	- The government provides partial financial assistance to SHGs which then decide whom the loan is to be given to for self employment activities.
		Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) is one such programme.
	- Three major programmes that aim at improving the food and nutritional status of the poor are Public Distribution System, Integrated Child Development
		Scheme and Midday Meal Scheme. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana, Valmiki Ambedkar Awas Yojana are also
		attempts in the same direction.
	
# POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMMES — A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT
	- These poverty alleviation programmes depend mainly on government and bank officials for their implementation. Since such officials are ill motivated,
		inadequately  trained, corruption prone and vulnerable to pressure from a variety of local elites, the resources are inefficiently used and wasted.
	- Poverty can effectively be eradicated only when the poor start contributing to growth by their active involvement in the growth process. This is
		possible through a process of social mobilisation, encouraging poor people to participate and get them empowered.
	- It is necessary to identify poverty stricken areas and provide infrastructure such as schools, roads, power, telecom, IT services, training 
		institutions etc.
	
# CONCLUSION
	- The objective of all our policies had been stated as promoting rapid and balanced economic development with equality and social justice.
	- There is improvement in terms of per capita income and average standard of living; some progress towards meeting the basic needs has been
		made. But when compared to the progress made by many other countries, our performance has not been impressive as the fruits
		of development have not reached all sections of the population.
	- Over the years, the government has been following three approaches to reduce poverty in India: growth oriented development, specific poverty
		alleviation programmes and meeting the minimum needs of the poor.
	- Government initiatives are yet to transform the ownership of assets, processes of production and meet the basic amenities of the poor.
	
# RECAP
	- Reducing poverty has been one of the major objectives of India’s developmental strategies.
	- The per capita consumption expenditure level which meets the average per capita daily requirement of 2,400 calories in rural areas and 2,100
		calories in urban areas, along with a minimum of non-food expenditure, is called poverty line or absolute poverty.
	- When the number of poor and their proportion is compared, we will have an idea of different levels of poverty of people and their distribution 
		between states and over time.
	- The number of poor in India and their proportion to total population has declined substantially. For the first time in the 1990s, the absolute
		number of poor has declined.
	- Majority of poor are residing in rural areas and engage themselves in casual and unskilled jobs.
	- Income and expenditure oriented approaches do not take into account many other attributes of the poor people.
	- Over the years, the government has been following three approaches to reduce poverty in India: growth oriented development, specific poverty
		alleviation programmes and meeting the minimum needs of the poor.
	- Government initiatives are yet to transform the ownership of assets, processes of production and meet the basic amenities of the poor.



-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-5 HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION IN INDIA		-----------------------------
	
	"... the wisdom of expending public and private funds on education is not to be
		measured by its direct fruits alone. It will be profitable as a mere investment,
		to give the masses of people much greater opportunities than they can generally
		avail themselves of. For by this means many, who would have died unknown,
		are enabled to get the start needed for bringing out their latent abilities".
				- Alfred Marshall
	
# INTRODUCTION
	- the labour skill of an educated person is more than that of an uneducated person and hence the former is able to generate more income than 
		the latter and his contribution to economic growth is, consequently, more.
		
# WHAT IS HUMAN CAPITAL?
	- we need good human capital to produce other human capital say, doctors, engineers. we need investment in human capital to produce more human
		capital out of human resources.
		
# SOURCES OF HUMAN CAPITAL
	- Investment in Education is considered as one of the main source of human capital. Others are Investments in health, on-the-job training, 
		migration and information are the other sources of human capital formation.
	- Health expenditure directly increases the supply of healthy labour force and is, thus, a source of human capital formation.
	- Unemployment is the reason for the rural-urban migration in India.
	- Expenditure incurred for acquiring information relating to the labour market and other markets is also a source of human capital 
		formation. Expenditure on migration and on-the-job training is also a source of human capital formation.
	- Human Capital and Economic Growth: Economic growth means the increase in real national income of a country; naturally, the contribution 
		of the educated person to economic growth is more than that of an illiterate person.
	- both education and health, along with many other factors like on-the-job training, job market information and migration, increase an
		individual’s income generating capacity.
	- Education provides knowledge to understand changes in society and scientific advancements, thus, facilitate inventions and innovations.
	
# HUMAN CAPITAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
	- Human capital considers education and health as a means to increase labour productivity.
	- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because only when people have the
		ability to read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, they will be able to make other choices which they value.
	
# HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION IN INDIA: GREAT PROSPECTS
	- when basic education and health care is considered as a right of the citizens, then it is essential that the government should provide
		education and health services free of cost for the deserving citizens and those from the socially oppressed classes.
	
# EDUCATION SECTOR IN INDIA
	- Growth in Government Expenditure on Education: on an average, the government spends less on tertiary education, 'expenditure per student' in
		tertiary education is higher than that of elementary
	- As we expand school education, we need more teachers who are trained in the higher educational institutions; therefore, expenditure on all levels
		of education should be increased.
	- In December 2002, the Government of India, through the 86th Amendment of the Constitution of India, made free and compulsory education a fundamental
		right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years.
	- The Tapas Majumdar Committee, appointed by the Government of India in 1998, estimated an expenditure of around Rs 1.37 lakh crores over 10 years 
		(1998-99 to 2006-07) to bring all Indian children in the age group of 6-14 years under the purview of school education.
	- In the Union Budget 2000-05, the Government of India levied a 2 per cent 'education cess' on all union taxes. The government estimated to get a 
		revenue of Rs 4,000-5,000 crores and the entire amount was earmarked for spending on elementary education.
	- Educational Achievements in India: educational achievements in a country are indicated in terms of adult literacy level, primary education
		completion rate and youth literacy rate.
		
# FUTURE PROSPECTS
	- Education for All — Still a Distant Dream: Though literacy rates for both — adults as well as youth — have increased, still the absolute number 
		of illiterates in India is as much as India’s population was at the time of independence.
	- Gender Equity — Better than Before: still the need to promote education for women in India is imminent for various reasons such as improving
		economic independence and social status of women and also because women education makes a favourable impact on fertility rate and health care
		of women and children.
	- Higher Education — a Few Takers: lesser and lesser number of people reaching the higher education level. The level of unemployment among educated
		youth is the highest.
	- the government should increase allocation for higher education and also improve the standard of higher education institutions, so that students are
		imparted employable skills in such institutions.
		
# CONCLUSION
	- The spread of education and health services across different sectors of society should be ensured so as to simultaneously attain economic
		growth and equity.
	- The concept of physical capital is the base for conceptualising human capital. There are some similarities as well as dissimilarities between the 
		two forms of capital formation.
	- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because only when people have the ability to
		read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, will they be able to make other choices which they value.		
		
# RECAP
	- Investments in education convert human beings into human capital; human capital represents enhanced labour productivity, which is an acquired ability
		and an outcome of deliberate investment decisions with an expectation that it will increase future income sources.
	- Investments in education, on-the-job training, health, migration and information are the sources of human capital formation.
	- The concept of physical capital is the base for conceptualising human capital. There are some similarities as well as dissimilarities between the two 
		forms of capital formation.
	- Investment in human capital formation is considered as efficient and growth enhancing.
	- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because only when people have the ability to
		read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, will they be able to make other choices which they value.
	- The percentage of 'education expenditure of total government expenditure' indicates the importance of education in the scheme of things before 
		the government.
		
		

-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-6 RURAL DEVELOPMENT		-----------------------------

		"Only the tillers of the soil live by the right. The rest form their train and eat
		only the bread of dependence".
			- Thiruvalluvar
		
# INTRODUCTION
	- Mahatma Gandhi once said that the real progress of India did not mean simply the growth and expansion of industrial urban centres but mainly the
		development of the villages.
	- one-third of rural India still lives in abject poverty. That is the reason why we have to see a developed rural India if our nation has to realise 
		real progress.
		
# WHAT IS RURAL DEVELOPMENT?
	- initiatives for development in India includes Development of human resources including literacy, more specifically, female literacy, education 
		and skill development, health, addressing both sanitation and public health. Also Land reforms.
	- Infrastructure development like electricity, irrigation, credit, marketing, transport facilities including construction of village roads and feeder
		roads to nearby highways, facilities for agriculture research and extension, and information dissemination.
	- significant improvement in the living conditions of the weaker sections of the population emphasising access to productive employment opportunities.
	- farming communities have to be provided with various means that help them increase the productivity of grains, cereals, vegetables and fruits. Also
		need to be given opportunities to diversify into various non-farm productive activities such as food processing.
	- Giving them better and more affordable access to healthcare, sanitation facilities at workplaces and homes and education for all would be prioritised  
		for rapid rural development.

# CREDIT AND MARKETING IN RURAL AREAS
	- Credit:
	- The time gap between sowing the crop and selling in market is quite long, so farmers borrow money to meet their expense on investment.
	- In Independence era the farmers were in debt-trap by money lenders, so to overcome this issue social banking and multi-agency introduced to
		meet the need of rural credit.
	- National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was set up in 1982 as an apex body to coordinate the activities of all institutions 
		involved in the rural financing system. Also introduced Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), cooperatives and land development banks as multi-agency system 
		to dispense adequate credit at cheaper rates.
	- Self Help Group (SHG) have emerged as formal credit requires verification documents for loans, so the small pool of shared money is used to
		lend money to the needy farmers. It is to be repaid in small instalments at reasonable interest rates.
	- Rural Banking — a Critical Appraisal:
	- Agricultural loans defaulters were chronically high, around 50% were "wilful defaulters" which was a threat to the smooth functioning of banking
		system and need to be controlled. 
	- To improve on this situation, bank need to change their approach from just being lenders to building up relationship banking with the borrower.
		Inculcating the habit of thrift and efficient utilisation of financial resources needs to be enhanced among the farmers too.
		
# AGRICULTURAL MARKET SYSTEM
	- In early days farmers were not having information on market price and no facility to store agricultural products which forced to sell at low
		prices.
	- The first step was regulation of markets to create orderly and transparent marketing conditions. This policy benefited farmers as well as
		consumers largely.
	- Second component is provision of physical infrastructure facilities like roads, railways, warehouses, godowns, cold storages and processing units.
	- Cooperative marketing, in realising fair prices for farmers’ products, is the third aspect of government initiative.
	- The fourth element is the policy instruments like (i) assurance of minimum support prices (MSP) for 24 agricultural products 
		(ii) maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice by Food Corporation of India and (iii) distribution of food grains and sugar through PDS.
		
	- These instruments are aimed at protecting the income of the farmers and providing food-grains at a subsidised rate to the poor. Despite government
		intervention, private trade (by moneylenders, rural political elites, big merchants and rich farmers) predominates agricultural markets.
	- Emerging Alternate Marketing Channels:several national and multinational fast food chains are increasingly entering into contracts/alliances with 
		farmers to encourage them to cultivate farm products (vegetables, fruits, etc.) of the  desired quality by providing them with not only seeds and
		other inputs but also assured procurement of the produce at pre-decided prices.
	- This will help in reducing the prices risk of  farmers and expand market for farm products.
	
# DIVERSIFICATION INTO PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES
	- Diversification includes two aspects: one relates to diversification of crop production and the other relates to a shift of workforce from agriculture
		to other allied activities (livestock, poultry, fisheries etc.) and non-agriculture sector.
	- Diversification in other areas are required as livelihood completely on Agriculture is risky. So expansion into other sectors is essential to provide
		supplementary gainful employment and in realising higher levels of income for rural people to overcome poverty and other tribulations.
	- Animal Husbandry: Livestock production provides increased stability in income, food security, transport, fuel and nutrition for the family without
		disrupting other food-producing activities.
	- Fisheries: The overall socio-economic status of fishermen is comparatively lower than that of other backward sectors of our economy. There is a need
		to increase credit facilities —cooperatives and SHGs — for fisher-women to meet the working capital requirements for marketing.
	- Horticulture: Blessed with a varying climate and soil conditions, India has adopted growing of diverse horticultural crops such as fruits,
		vegetables, tuber crops, flowers, medicinal and aromatic plants, spices and plantation crops.
	- The period between 1991-2003 is also called an effort to heralding a ‘Golden Revolution’ because during this period, the planned investment in 
		horticulture became highly productive and the sector emerged as a sustainable livelihood option.
	- Horticulture has emerged as a successful sustainable livelihood option and needs to be encouraged significantly. Enhancing its role requires investment
		in infrastructure like electricity, cold storage systems, marketing linkages, small-scale processing units and technology improvement and 
		dissemination.

# SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANIC FARMING
	- Conventional agriculture relies heavily on chemical fertilisers and toxic pesticides etc., which enter the food supply, penetrate the water sources,
		harm the livestock, deplete the soil and devastate natural eco-systems.
	- organic agriculture is a whole system of farming that restores, maintains and enhances the ecological balance.
	- Benefits of Organic Farming: Organic agriculture offers a means to substitute costlier agricultural inputs with locally produced organic inputs that
		are cheaper and thereby generate good returns on investment.
	- Inadequate infrastructure and the problem of marketing the products are major concerns which need to be addressed apart from an appropriate 
		agriculture policy to promote organic farming.
	- Organic produce may also have more blemishes and a shorter shelf life than sprayed produce. Moreover choice in production of off-season crops is 
		quite limited in organic farming.

# CONCLUSION
	- There is a greater need today to make rural areas more vibrant through diversification into dairying, poultry, fisheries, vegetables and fruits
		and linking up the rural production centres with the urban and foreign (export) markets to realise higher returns on the investments for the
		products.
	- infrastructure elements like credit and marketing, farmer-friendly agricultural policies and a constant appraisal and dialogue between farmers’ groups
		and state agricultural departments are essential to realise the full potential of the sector.
	- we need to learn from, and also try out when found relevant, practices from the available set of 'best practice' illustrations, to speed up
		this process of 'learning by doing'.
		
# RECAP
	- Rural Development is quite a comprehensive term but it essentially means a plan of action for the development of areas which
		are lagging behind in socio-economic development.
	- There is a need for improving the quantity and quality of infrastructure in rural areas such as banking, marketing, storage,
		transport and communications etc. to realise its true potential.
	- Diversification towards new areas such as livestock, fisheries and other non-agricultural activities is necessary not only to
		reduce the risk from agriculture sector but also to provide productive sustainable livelihood options to our rural people.
	- The importance of organic farming as an environmentally sustainable production process is on a rise an needs to be promoted.		
		


-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-7 EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, INFORMALISATION AND OTHER ISSUES		-----------------------------


		"What I object to, is the 'craze' for machinery, not machinery as such. The
	craze is for what they call labour-saving machinery. Men go on 'saving labour'
	till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of
	starvation... "
		- Mahatma Gandhi

# INTRODUCTION
	- Every working person is actively contributing to national income the development of the country by engaging in various economic activities — that
		is the real meaning of 'earning' a living.
	- Studying about working people gives us insights into the quality and nature of employment in our country and helps to analyse the contribution made
		by different industries and sectors towards national income.
		
# WORKERS AND EMPLOYMENT
	- Farmers working on fields, produce food grains and raw materials for industries, like cotton becomes cloth in mills. The total money value of all 
		such good and services produced in a country in a year is called its gross domestic product for that year.
	- Also consider paying for imports & received for exports there is a net earning for the country which may be positive (export > import), or
		negative (if export < import), or zero (if export = import).
	- When we add this earning (plus or minus) from foreign transactions, what we get is called the country’s gross national product for that year.
	- Those activities contribute to the Gross National Product are called economic activity.
	- India has multi-faceted employment, so are employed for few months in a year and some are employed throughout a year.
	- Men has major contribution to work-force, Women do contribute to work force but are not paid many a times.

# PARTICIPATION OF PEOPLE IN EMPLOYMENT
	- Worker-population ratio is useful in knowing the proportion of population that is actively contributing to the production of goods and services of 
		a country.
	- People in rural areas have limited resources to earn a higher income and participate more in the employment market. Many don't go to schools or school
		drop-outs. These people cannot stay at home as their economic condition may not allow them to do so.
	- In urban areas, a considerable section is able to study in various educational institutions, having a variety of employment opportunities. They look
		for the appropriate job to suit their qualifications and skills.
	- Many activities for the household engaged in by women are not recognised as productive work.
	
# SELF-EMPLOYED AND HIRED WORKERS
	- Workers who own and operate an enterprise to earn their livelihood are known as self-employed. More than half the workforce in India belongs to this
		category.
	- The construction workers are known as casual wage labourers; they account for 33 per cent of India’s workforce.
	- When a worker is engaged by someone or an enterprise and paid his or her wages on a regular basis, they are known as regular salaried employees and 
		it accounts for 15 per cent of India's work-force.
	- regular salaried jobs require skills and a higher level of literacy, women might not have been engaged to a great extent.
	- the self-employed and casual wage labourers are found more in rural areas than in urban areas.
	- In Urban areas the self-employed and regular wage salaried are more and in rural areas self-employed are more as they're mostly dependent on
		agriculture.
		
# EMPLOYMENT IN FIRMS, FACTORIES AND OFFICES
	- the industrial sector begins to lose its share of total employment as the service sector enters a period of rapid expansion.
	- we divide all economic activities into eight different industrial divisions. They are
		(i) Agriculture
		(ii) Mining and Quarrying
		(iii) Manufacturing
 		(iv) Electricity, Gas and Water Supply
		(v) Construction
		(vi) Trade
 		(vii) Transport and Storage and	
		(viii) Services.
	- working persons engaged in these divisions can be clubbed into three major sectors
		(a) primary sector which includes (i) and (ii) 
		(b) secondary sector which includes (iii), (iv) and (v)
		(c) service sector which includes divisions (vi), (vii) and (viii).
	
# GROWTH AND CHANGING STRUCTURE OF EMPLOYMENT
	- Developmental strategies in many countries, including India, have aimed at reducing the proportion of people depending on agriculture.
	- Distribution of workforce by industrial sectors shows substantial shift from farm work to non-farm work.
	- The distribution of workforce in different status indicates that over the last three decades (1972-2000), people have moved from self-employment
		and regular salaried employment to casual wage work.
	- Scholars call this process of moving from self-employment and regular salaried employment to casual wage work as "casualisation of workforce".

# INFORMALISATION OF INDIAN WORKFORCE
	- a small section of Indian workforce is getting regular income. The government, through its labour laws, protects them in various ways. This section
		of the workforce forms trade unions, bargains with employers for better wages and other social security measures.
	- All the public sector establishments and those private sector establishments which employ 10 hired workers or more are called formal sector 
		establishments and those who work in such establishments are formal sector workers.
	- All other enterprises and workers working in those enterprises form the informal sector. Thus, informal sector includes millions of farmers, 
		agricultural labourers, owners of small enterprises and people working in those enterprises as also the self-employed who do not have any 
		hired workers.
	- Workers and enterprises in the informal sector do not get regular income; they do not have any protection or regulation from the government
		and are dismissed without any compensation.
	- Owing to the efforts of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Indian government has initiated the modernisation of informal sector
		enterprises and provision of social security measures to informal sector workers.
	
# UNEMPLOYMENT
	- Economists define unemployed person as one who is not able to get employment of even one hour in half a day.
	- There are three sources of data on unemployment : Reports of Census of India, National Sample Survey Organisation’s Reports of Employment
		and Unemployment Situation and Directorate General of Employment and Training Data of Registration with Employment Exchanges.
	- they provide different estimates of unemployment, they do provide us with the attributes of the unemployed and the variety of unemployment
		prevailing in our country.
	- "Open unemployment" is the person looking for jobs vacancy in newspapers, companies, etc.
	- unemployment prevailing in Indian farms as "disguised unemployment". Like 5 workers are doing the 2 workers job.
	- "Seasonal unemployment" is like when farmer looks for jobs in urban areas after rainy season.
	- The government has taken many initiatives to generate acceptable employment, ensuring at least minimal safety and job satisfaction, through
		various measures.
		
# GOVERNMENT AND EMPLOYMENT GENERATION
	- The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 which promises 100 days of guaranteed wage employment to all adult members of rural households 
		who volunteer to do unskilled manual work.
	- This scheme is one of the many measures that the government implements to generate employment for those who are in need of jobs in rural areas.
	- All these as employment generation programmes aim at providing not only employment but also services in areas such as primary health, primary 
		education, rural shelter, rural drinking water, nutrition, assistance for people to buy income and employment generating assets, development of 
		community assets by generating wage employment, construction of houses and sanitation, assistance for constructing houses, laying of rural roads,
		development of wastelands/degraded lands.
	- Newly emerging jobs are found mostly in the service sector, Outsourcing of work is becoming a common practice. A big firm finds it
		profitable to close down some of its specialist departments and hand over a large number of small piecemeal jobs to very small enterprises or
		specialist individuals sometimes situated even in other countries.
	- there has been rapid growth in the gross domestic product, but without simultaneous increase in employment opportunities. This has forced the
		government to take up initiatives in generating employment opportunities particularly in the rural areas.
		
# RECAP
	- All those persons who are engaged in various economic activities and hence contribute to national product are workers.
	- About two-fifth of the total population in the country is engaged in various economic activities.
	- Men particularly rural men, form the major section of workforce in India.
	- Majority of workers in India are self-employed. Casual wage labourers and regular salaried employees together account for less than half the
		proportion of India’s workforce.
	- About three-fifth of India’s workforce depends on agriculture and other allied activities as the major source of livelihood.
	- In recent years, the growth of employment has decelerated.
	- Post reforms, India has been witness to employment opportunities in the service sector. These new jobs are found mostly in the informal sector
		and the nature of jobs is also mostly casual.
	- Government is the major formal sector employer in the country.
	- Acquiring skills and undergoing training are important for getting employment.
	- Disguised unemployment is a common form of unemployment in rural India.
	- There has been a change in the structure of the workforce in India.
	- Through various schemes and policies, the government takes initiatives to generate employment directly and indirectly.
