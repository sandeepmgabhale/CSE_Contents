	1. Start at the centre of a blank, landscape page, ideally with a colourful image to represent your subject.
	2. Use words and pictures throughout your map. Whenever possible use single KEY words, printed along a line. Each word or picture
		sits on its own line.
	3. The lines make the associations between ideas as clear as possible. Make them flowing and organic, each line the same length as 
		the word or image. Always ensure that lines connect to the end of the line at the previous level. Typically lines will be thicker
		at the centre and thinner further out.
	4. Experiment with different ways of linking and emphasising different aspects. Use highlighters, codes and arrows as necessary.
	5. The Structure that should develop will be a 'radiant hierarchy' with ideas radiating out from your central theme and main branches.

# How to Make a Mind Map [ Source http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Mind-Map ]
	Mind mapping is one of the most common types of information processing. It should be used when a writer encounters writers' block or when the writer is
	having trouble organizing thoughts or ideas. Problem solvers can use mind maps to address creative challenges without prejudgement and to allocate resources
	effectively.		
	Mind mapping visualization spawns ideas that are connected to a central topic, but the technique can also be used to "flesh out" ideas that have already been
	targeted as potential solutions. Mind mapping is often used by writers to gather their thoughts and ideas before they lay pen to paper. A mind map should be
	a web-like structure of words and ideas that are loosely tied to one another. Here are some guidelines for crafting a useful mind map.
	
	STEPS::
	1. Understand potential uses of mind maps.
		- Revision notes.
		- Brainstorming. This can be done in a group also.
		- Planning. Project, job interview, CV, presentation.
		- Learning a language.
        - Goal setting.
        - Note taking during a meeting or lecture.
        - Decision making.
        - Book summary.
        - Creative writing.
        - Recording the family history.
        - Research.
	2. Prepare a rough draft. 
		- Quickly put together a rough draft. Redraft with colours, images and printed words.
	3. Generate a topic.
		- What will be the focus of your thinking? Your topic should be no more than a few words. By keeping your topic simple, you will be able to attach
			aspects and attributes precisely and in an understandable way. A broader topic will give you more to work with in the future.
	4. Place that topic in the center of the page.
		- Ideally you want a pictogram or visual representation of the central topic. Writing the topic in bold letters should be reserved for things without
			any conceivable visual form.
	5. Size. 
		- Mind maps should be no larger than an A4 piece of paper. To cover more topics, come up with a master mind map which acts as a contents page for
			various smaller mind maps. Attach more paper as needed. Break the "on the page" mentality.
	6. Use free association to start the ideas flowing. 
		- Record what comes to mind. As you generate thoughts, draw branches from the main topic. Keep words to a minimum, capturing the essence of each
			thought succinctly. As your mind map grows, continue to pare the number of words per branch. Print clearly.
	7. Brainstorming.
		- If you are brainstorming ideas, it can help to start out with: what, why, where, when and how.
	8. Be concise with the choice of words for your map.
		- Write single words or simple phrases.
	9. Continue branching.
		- Make more branches off of your main topic. Try to extend your thoughts from one idea to the next. Draw lines between thoughts to create lateral
		thinking.
	10. As new ideas come forth, draw additional branches from your topic.
		- Expand as necessary.
	11. Repeat branching until all your ideas appear on the map.
	12. When you are finished mapping, carefully study the connections that you have made and try to refine the relationships.
		- What larger patterns have you uncovered?
		
	TIPS::
		- Don't get stuck in one area, keep your ideas flowing. Do not be discouraged if some of your branches prove unpromising. Just start at the central
			idea and work your way out again.
		- Colour should be used: It makes your mind maps memorable and can help to differentiate and/or tie together your ideas and branch patterns.
		- Always try to organize your thoughts and ideas!
		- Revise once a week after making the mind map.
		- Record what you are thinking by speaking out loud.
		- Don't be afraid to bring out your inner artist.
		- No censorship is allowed in this type of invention.
		- Make a draft to get ideas.
		- Keep one branch of thought one color and another branch a different color.
			Graphics can almost always replace words. Feel free to draw pictures instead of writing words. (Or use images along side the words to enhance 
			and augment the words.)
			
	WARNINGS::
		- Keeping your map clean is essential. If your map becomes too messy, it will be harder to go back and understand what you have written.
		
	THINGS YOU'LL NEED::
		- A4 Paper
		- Pen/Pencil
		- Colored markers or colored pencils

# Mind map guidelines [ Source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map ]
	Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:
       - Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
       - Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
       - Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
       - Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
       - The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
       - Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
       - Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
       - Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
       - Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
       - Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.
