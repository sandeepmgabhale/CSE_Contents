-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-1 INDIAN ECONOMY ON THE EVE OF INDEPENDENCE		-----------------------------
# Agriculture was the main source of livelihood, besides that handicraft industries in the field of cotton and silk, metal and 
	precious stone
	
# Stagnation in agriculture was caused mainly because of various system of land settlement introduced by colonial government.
	Zamindari system where the zamindars where interested only collecting the rent, no interest in the improvement of 
	agricultural conditions

# Low levels of technology, lack of lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilisers, all added up to aggravate
	the plight of the farmers and contributed to the dismal level of agricultural productivity. Commercialization of agriculture 
	producing the cash crops which were to be ultimately used by Britisher back home
	
# Lack of adequate public health facilities, occurrence of frequent natural calamities and famines pauperised the hapless Indian 
	people and resulted in engendering high mortality rates

# The primary motive of the colonial government behind this policy of systematically deindustrialising India was two-fold.
	First, to reduce India to the status of a mere exporter of important raw materials for the upcoming modern industries in
	Britain and, second, to turn India into a sprawling market for the finished products of those industries so that
	their continued expansion could be ensured to the maximum advantage of their home country — Britain

# There was no Capital goods industry to help promote the industrialisation, there was few establishment of traditional handicraft
	industries. Still contribution to GDP growth remained small
	
# Britain maintained a monopoly control over India’s exports and imports. As a result, more than half of India’s foreign trade was
	restricted to Britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like China, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Persia (Iran)

# The real motive behind Infrastructure development was not to provide basic amenities to the people but to sub-serve various 
	colonial interests. Infrastructure like Roads, railways, etc.
	
# The agricultural sector was already saddled with surplus labour and extremely low productivity. The industrial sector was crying for
	modernisation, diversification, capacity building and increased public investment economic policy. In a nutshell, the social and 
	economic challenges before the country were enormous.
	


-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-2 INDIAN ECONOMY 1950-1990		-----------------------------
# Among the thinkers contribution to the five-year plans, the statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was the architect 
	of Indian Planning

# Goals of five year plans are Growth, Modernisation, self-reliance, Equity. It is not that all the plans have given importance 
	to all these goals. Due to limitation of resources choice were made in each plan to which of the goal be given primary importance.
	
# Growth: 
	- to increase in the country’s capacity to produce the output of goods and services within the country
	- steady increase in GDP is the good indicator of economic growth
	- GDP is the market value of all the goods and services produced in the country during a year
	- The GDP of a country is derived from the different sector’s of the economy, namely the agricultural sector, the
		industrial sector and the service sector

# Modernisation: 
	- To increase the production of goods and services the producers have to adopt new technology
	- modernisation does not refer only to the use of new technology but also to changes in social outlook such as the recognition
		that women should have the same rights as men
	
# Self-reliance: 
	- A nation can promote economic growth and modernisation by using its own resources or by using resources imported from other 
		nations
	- first seven fiver-year plans used self-reliance by avoiding imports of those goods and services which could be produced in
		India
	- it was necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign countries, especially for food. This steps were taken out of fear that 
		dependence on imported food supplies, foreign technology and foreign capital may make India's sovereignty vulnerable to 
		foreign interference in our policies
		
# Equity:
	- It is important to ensure that the benefits of economic prosperity reach the poor sections as well instead of being enjoyed 
		only by the rich
	- So, in addition to growth, modernisation and self-reliance, equity is also important: every Indian should be able to meet his 
		or her basic needs such as food, a decent house, education and health care and inequality in the distribution of wealth
		should be reduced
	
# Land Reforms:
	- to reduce the Zamindari and improve the agriculture productivity
	- ownership of land would give incentives to the tillers to invest in making improvements provided sufficient capital was made
		available to them
	- Land reforms were successful in Kerala and West Bengal because these states had governments committed to the policy of land to 
		the tiller. Unfortunately other states did not have the same level of commitment and vast inequality in landholding
	
# Land Ceiling: 
	- fixing the maximum size of land which could be owned by an individual. The purpose of land ceiling was to reduce the 
		concentration of land ownership in a few hands.
	- the goal of equity was not fully served by abolition of intermediaries
	- The land ceiling legislation also faced hurdles due lots of loop holes which exploited by the big landholders to retain
		their land.
		
# The Green Revolution: 
	- Productivity in the agricultural sector was very low because of the use of old technology and the absence of required infrastructure
		for the vast majority of farmers
	- India’s agriculture vitally depends on the monsoon and shortfall of monsoon leads to access the irrigation facilities which very
		few farmers had
	- The stagnation in agriculture, which was in the colonial period, was ridden off due to the large increase in production of food grains
		resulting from the use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds especially for wheat and rice
	- the HYV technology spread to a larger number of states and benefited more variety of crops. The spread of green revolution technology 
		enabled India to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains;
	- reducing/removing the dependency on America or other nations for meeting our nation’s food requirements
	- the government provided loans at a low interest rate to small farmers and subsidised fertilisers so that small farmers could also have
		access to the needed inputs
	- The risk of the small farmers being ruined when pests attack their crops was considerably reduced by the services rendered by research 
		institutes established by the government
