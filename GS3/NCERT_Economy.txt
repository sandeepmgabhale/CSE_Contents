-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-1 INDIAN ECONOMY ON THE EVE OF INDEPENDENCE		-----------------------------
# Agriculture was the main source of livelihood, besides that handicraft industries in the field of cotton and silk, metal and 
	precious stone
	
# Stagnation in agriculture was caused mainly because of various system of land settlement introduced by colonial government.
	Zamindari system where the zamindars where interested only collecting the rent, no interest in the improvement of 
	agricultural conditions

# Low levels of technology, lack of lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilisers, all added up to aggravate
	the plight of the farmers and contributed to the dismal level of agricultural productivity. Commercialization of agriculture 
	producing the cash crops which were to be ultimately used by Britisher back home
	
# Lack of adequate public health facilities, occurrence of frequent natural calamities and famines pauperised the hapless Indian 
	people and resulted in engendering high mortality rates

# The primary motive of the colonial government behind this policy of systematically deindustrialising India was two-fold.
	First, to reduce India to the status of a mere exporter of important raw materials for the upcoming modern industries in
	Britain and, second, to turn India into a sprawling market for the finished products of those industries so that
	their continued expansion could be ensured to the maximum advantage of their home country — Britain

# There was no Capital goods industry to help promote the industrialisation, there was few establishment of traditional handicraft
	industries. Still contribution to GDP growth remained small
	
# Britain maintained a monopoly control over India’s exports and imports. As a result, more than half of India’s foreign trade was
	restricted to Britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like China, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Persia (Iran)

# The real motive behind Infrastructure development was not to provide basic amenities to the people but to sub-serve various 
	colonial interests. Infrastructure like Roads, railways, etc.
	
# The agricultural sector was already saddled with surplus labour and extremely low productivity. The industrial sector was crying for
	modernisation, diversification, capacity building and increased public investment economic policy. In a nutshell, the social and 
	economic challenges before the country were enormous.
	


-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-2 INDIAN ECONOMY 1950-1990		-----------------------------
# Among the thinkers contribution to the five-year plans, the statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was the architect 
	of Indian Planning

# Goals of five year plans are Growth, Modernisation, self-reliance, Equity. It is not that all the plans have given importance 
	to all these goals. Due to limitation of resources choice were made in each plan to which of the goal be given primary importance.
	
# Growth: 
	- to increase in the country’s capacity to produce the output of goods and services within the country
	- steady increase in GDP is the good indicator of economic growth
	- GDP is the market value of all the goods and services produced in the country during a year
	- The GDP of a country is derived from the different sector’s of the economy, namely the agricultural sector, the
		industrial sector and the service sector

# Modernisation: 
	- To increase the production of goods and services the producers have to adopt new technology
	- modernisation does not refer only to the use of new technology but also to changes in social outlook such as the recognition
		that women should have the same rights as men
	
# Self-reliance: 
	- A nation can promote economic growth and modernisation by using its own resources or by using resources imported from other 
		nations
	- first seven fiver-year plans used self-reliance by avoiding imports of those goods and services which could be produced in
		India
	- it was necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign countries, especially for food. This steps were taken out of fear that 
		dependence on imported food supplies, foreign technology and foreign capital may make India's sovereignty vulnerable to 
		foreign interference in our policies
		
# Equity:
	- It is important to ensure that the benefits of economic prosperity reach the poor sections as well instead of being enjoyed 
		only by the rich
	- So, in addition to growth, modernisation and self-reliance, equity is also important: every Indian should be able to meet his 
		or her basic needs such as food, a decent house, education and health care and inequality in the distribution of wealth
		should be reduced
	
# Land Reforms:
	- to reduce the Zamindari and improve the agriculture productivity
	- ownership of land would give incentives to the tillers to invest in making improvements provided sufficient capital was made
		available to them
	- Land reforms were successful in Kerala and West Bengal because these states had governments committed to the policy of land to 
		the tiller. Unfortunately other states did not have the same level of commitment and vast inequality in landholding
	
# Land Ceiling: 
	- fixing the maximum size of land which could be owned by an individual. The purpose of land ceiling was to reduce the 
		concentration of land ownership in a few hands.
	- the goal of equity was not fully served by abolition of intermediaries
	- The land ceiling legislation also faced hurdles due lots of loop holes which exploited by the big landholders to retain
		their land.
		
# The Green Revolution: 
	- Productivity in the agricultural sector was very low because of the use of old technology and the absence of required infrastructure
		for the vast majority of farmers
	- India’s agriculture vitally depends on the monsoon and shortfall of monsoon leads to access the irrigation facilities which very
		few farmers had
	- The stagnation in agriculture, which was in the colonial period, was ridden off due to the large increase in production of food grains
		resulting from the use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds especially for wheat and rice
	- the HYV technology spread to a larger number of states and benefited more variety of crops. The spread of green revolution technology 
		enabled India to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains;
	- reducing/removing the dependency on America or other nations for meeting our nation’s food requirements
	- the government provided loans at a low interest rate to small farmers and subsidised fertilisers so that small farmers could also have
		access to the needed inputs
	- The risk of the small farmers being ruined when pests attack their crops was considerably reduced by the services rendered by research 
		institutes established by the government
		
# Debate our Subsidies:
	- It was decided that subsidies should be given to the farmers to test and implement new technology for farming like HYV (High yielding 
		variety), as new technology is risky
	- to encourage farmers subsidies to be given and once the technology is found profitably and widely adopted the subsidies to be phased out
	- Otherwise, still continuing subsidies will be burden on government as it does not benefit the target group
	- if subsidies are largely benefiting the fertiliser industry and big farmers, the correct policy is not to abolish subsidies but to take
		steps to ensure that only the poor farmers enjoy the benefits
	- Economists found that between 1950-1990 the GDP contribution by agriculture decline significantly but not the population depending on it
	- the industrial sector and the service sector did not absorb the people working in the agricultural sector, this an important failure of 
		our policies followed during 1950-1990.
		
# Industry and Trade
	- Economists have found that poor nation can progress only if they have good industrial sector, as it provides stable employment than
		agriculture.
	- Industrial sector promote modernisation and overall prosperity. Thus, five-year plans place more emphasis on the industrial development.
	- Market and State in Indian Industrial Development: The state would have complete control of those industries that were vital for
		the economy.
	- Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 (IPR 1956): This policy was categorized in 3 sections, and it was encourage for promoting industry in 
		backward regions and gives easier way for licensing, giving certain concessions like tax benefits and electricity at lower tariff.
	- Small scale Industry: for promoting rural development, also given concessions such as lower excise duty and bank loans at lower
		interest rates.
# Trade Policy: Import Substitution
	- Instead of importing the vehicles from foreign countries, it was encourage to produce them in India itself and protect the domestic firm 
		from competing the foreign firms.
	- Tariffs are a tax on imported goods; they make imported goods more expensive and discourage their use. Quotas specify the quantity of goods
		which can be imported.
	- The rise in the industry’s share of GDP is an important indicator of development. No more the industrial sector was restricted to only textile
		and jute. It was well diversified, largely due to public sector.
	- scholars point out that the public sector is not meant for earning profits but to promote the welfare of the nation
	- One of the major drawbacks in the industrial sector was the inefficient functioning of the public sector as it started incurring losses leading
		to drain on the nation’s limited resources

	
-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-3 LIBERALISATION PRIVATISATION AND GLOBALISATION		-----------------------------
# This chapter talks about the financial crisis that occurred in 1991.

# Background
	- The bad economic management leads to crisis, even the foreign reserves were consumed.
	- imports were increased and more than the export, so India recieved loan from World Bank and IMF.
	- In return the foreign investors asked to remove the restriction on trade and private sector to reduce less involvement of Government
		in the private business. To which India agreed and announced the New Economic Policy (NEP).
	- there was a need to maintain sufficient foreign exchange reserves and keep the rising prices under control.
	- aimed at improving the efficiency of the economy and increasing its international competitiveness by removing the rigidities in various
		segments of the Indian economy.
		
# LIBERALISATION
	- introduced to put an end to these restrictions and open up various sectors of the economy.
	- Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all but product categories — alcohol, cigarettes, hazardous chemicals industrial explosives, 
		electronics, aerospace and drugs and pharmaceuticals.
	- reserved for the public sector are defence equipments, atomic energy generation and railway transport.
	- Financial reforms for Indian and foreign banks, FII allowed to invest in Indian financial markets.
	- Tax reforms consists of Direct and Indirect taxes.
	- direct taxes on incomes of individuals as well as profits of business enterprises.
	- indirect taxes levied on commodities, in order to facilitate the establishment of a common national market for goods and commodities.
	- Foreign Exchange Reforms as an immediate measure to resolve the balance of payments crisis, the rupee was devalued against foreign
		currencies.
	- Trade and Investment Policy Reforms: aim was also to promote the efficiency of the local industries and the adoption of modern
		technologies.
	- Export duties have been removed to increase the competitive position of Indian goods in the international markets.
	
# PRIVATISATION
	- to improve financial discipline and facilitate modernisation.
	- private capital and managerial capabilities could be effectively utilised to improve the performance of the PSUs.
	
# GLOBALISATION
	- Globalisation is the outcome of the policies of liberalisation and privatisation.
	- It is integration of the economy of the country with the world economy, outcome of the set of various policies that are aimed
		at transforming the world towards greater interdependence and integration.
	- It involves creation of networks and activities transcending economic, social and geographical boundaries.
	- Outsourcing is part of globalisation, low wage rates and availability of skilled man power in India able to bagged outsourcing from
		foreign MNCs.
	- The World Trade Organization (WTO) was founded in 1995 as the successor organisation to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT).

# INDIAN ECONOMY DURING REFORMS: AN ASSESSMENT
	- there has been an increase in the overall GDP growth in the reform period.
	- During the reform period, the growth of agriculture and industrial sectors has declined whereas the growth of service sector has gone up.
		This indicates that the growth is mainly driven by the growth in the service sector.
	- India is seen as a successful exporter of auto parts, engineering goods, IT software and textiles in the reform period.
	- the reform process has been widely criticised for not being able to address some of the basic problems facing our economy especially
		in the areas of employment, agriculture, industry, infrastructure development and fiscal management.
	- Though the GDP growth rate has increased in the reform period, scholars point out that the reform-led growth has not generated sufficient
		employment.
	- Reforms in Agriculture: reduced the growth rate, because the Public investment is reduced in agriculture sector like irrigation, research, etc.
		Also removal of fertiliser subsidy has led to increase in the cost of production.
	- Reforms in Industry: developing countries are compelled to open up their economies to greater flow of goods and capital from developed countries
		and rendering their industries vulnerable to imported goods.
	- a developing country like India still does not have the access to developed countries’ markets because of high non-tariff barriers.
	- Disinvestment as per Critics, the assets of PSUs has been undervalued and sold to private sector. There has been substantial loss to the 
		government.
	- Reforms and Fiscal Policies: The tax reductions aimed at yielding larger revenue which didn't succeed. Also the tax incentives were provided
		foreign investors which further reduced the scope for raising tax revenues.

-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-4 POVERTY		-----------------------------

# This chapter talks about some of the most challenging issues facing India today are poverty, development of rural India and building 
	infrastructure.
	
# WHO ARE THE POOR?
	- Starvation and hunger are the key features of the poorest households. The poor lack basic literacy and skills and hence have very limited 
		economic opportunities. 
	- Poor people also face unstable employment, they are highly vulnerable. A large section of poor people do not even have access to safe 
		drinking water. 
	- Extreme gender inequality in the participation of gainful employment, education and in decision-making within the family.
	- The urban poor are largely the overflow of the rural poor who had migrated to urban areas in search of alternative employment and livelihood, 
		labourers who do a variety of casual jobs and the self-employed who sell a variety of things on roadsides and are engaged in various activities.
	
# HOW ARE POOR PEOPLE IDENTIFIED?
	- there is need to develop a scale to measure poverty, and the factors that make up the criteria for this measurement or mechanism need
		to be carefully chosen.
	- For the purpose of defining poverty we divide people into two categories; the poor and the non-poor and the poverty line separates the
		two. So there are different kinds of poor and non-poor.
	- There are many factors, other than income and assets, which are associated with poverty; for instance, the accessibility to basic education,
		health care, drinking water and sanitation.
	- The aim of poverty alleviation schemes should be to improve human lives by expanding the range of things that a person could be and could do,
		such as to be healthy and well-nourished, to be knowledgeable and participate in the life of a community.	
	- development is about removing the obstacles to the things that a person can do in life, such as illiteracy, ill health,
		lack of access to resources, or lack of civil and political freedoms.

# THE NUMBER OF POOR IN INDIA
	- In 1990s, the absolute number of poor in rural areas had declined whereas the number of their urban counterparts increased marginally.
	- The poverty ratio declined continuously for both urban and rural areas, but declined slowly.

# WHAT CAUSES POVERTY?
	- individual circumstances and/or characteristics of poor people like examples are low levels of education and skills, infirmity, ill
		health, sickness, discrimination.
	- Poverty is also explained by general, economy-wide problems, such as low capital formation, lack of infrastructure, lack of demand, pressure
		of population, lack of social/welfare nets.
	- The urban poor in India are largely the overflow of the rural poor who migrate to urban areas in search of employment and a livelihood. 
		Industrialisation has not been able to absorb all these people.
	- Most of the urban poor are either unemployed or intermittently employed as casual labourers. Casual labours are more vulnerable in the 
		society as they have no job security, no assets, limited skills, sparse opportunities and no surplus to sustain them.
	- Poverty is, therefore, also closely related to nature of employment. Unemployment or under employment and the casual and intermittent nature
		of work in both rural and urban areas that compels indebtedness, in turn, reinforces poverty.
	- The unequal distribution of income and assets has also led to the persistence of poverty in India.
	
# POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES TOWARDS POVERTY ALLEVIATION
	- To quote the First Five Year Plan (1951-56), "the urge to bring economic and social change under present conditions comes from the fact of poverty
		and inequalities in income, wealth and opportunity".
	- The Second Five Year Plan (1956-61) also pointed out that "the benefits of economic development must accrue more and more to the relatively less
		privileged classes of society".
	- Examples of self employment programmes are Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP), Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY) and Swarna
		Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY). The first programme aims at creating self employment opportunities in rural areas and small towns.
	- The educated unemployed from low income families in rural and urban areas can get financial help to set up any kind of enterprise that generates
		employment under PMRY. SJSRY mainly aims at creating employment opportunities both self-employment and wage employment in urban areas.
	- The government provides partial financial assistance to SHGs which then decide whom the loan is to be given to for self employment activities.
		Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) is one such programme.
	- Three major programmes that aim at improving the food and nutritional status of the poor are Public Distribution System, Integrated Child Development
		Scheme and Midday Meal Scheme. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana, Valmiki Ambedkar Awas Yojana are also
		attempts in the same direction.
	
# POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMMES — A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT
	- These poverty alleviation programmes depend mainly on government and bank officials for their implementation. Since such officials are ill motivated,
		inadequately  trained, corruption prone and vulnerable to pressure from a variety of local elites, the resources are inefficiently used and wasted.
	- Poverty can effectively be eradicated only when the poor start contributing to growth by their active involvement in the growth process. This is
		possible through a process of social mobilisation, encouraging poor people to participate and get them empowered.
	- It is necessary to identify poverty stricken areas and provide infrastructure such as schools, roads, power, telecom, IT services, training 
		institutions etc.
	
# CONCLUSION
	- The objective of all our policies had been stated as promoting rapid and balanced economic development with equality and social justice.
	- There is improvement in terms of per capita income and average standard of living; some progress towards meeting the basic needs has been
		made. But when compared to the progress made by many other countries, our performance has not been impressive as the fruits
		of development have not reached all sections of the population.
	- Over the years, the government has been following three approaches to reduce poverty in India: growth oriented development, specific poverty
		alleviation programmes and meeting the minimum needs of the poor.
	- Government initiatives are yet to transform the ownership of assets, processes of production and meet the basic amenities of the poor.



-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-5 HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION ININDIA		-----------------------------
# INTRODUCTION
	- the labour skill of an educated person is more than that of an uneducated person and hence the former is able to generate more income than 
		the latter and his contribution to economic growth is, consequently, more.
		
# WHAT IS HUMAN CAPITAL?
	- we need good human capital to produce other human capital say, doctors, engineers. we need investment in human capital to produce more human
		capital out of human resources.
		
# SOURCES OF HUMAN CAPITAL
	- Investment in Education is considered as one of the main source of human capital. Others are Investments in health, on-the-job training, 
		migration and information are the other sources of human capital formation.
	- Health expenditure directly increases the supply of healthy labour force and is, thus, a source of human capital formation.
	- Unemployment is the reason for the rural-urban migration in India.
	- Expenditure incurred for acquiring information relating to the labour market and other markets is also a source of human capital 
		formation. Expenditure on migration and on-the-job training is also a source of human capital formation.
	- Human Capital and Economic Growth: Economic growth means the increase in real national income of a country; naturally, the contribution 
		of the educated person to economic growth is more than that of an illiterate person.
	- both education and health, along with many other factors like on-the-job training, job market information and migration, increase an
		individual’s income generating capacity.
	- Education provides knowledge to understand changes in society and scientific advancements, thus, facilitate inventions and innovations.
	
# HUMAN CAPITAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
	- Human capital considers education and health as a means to increase labour productivity.
	- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because only when people have the
		ability to read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, they will be able to make other choices which they value.
	
# HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION IN INDIA: GREAT PROSPECTS
	- when basic education and health care is considered as a right of the citizens, then it is essential that the government should provide
		education and health services free of cost for the deserving citizens and those from the socially oppressed classes.
	
# EDUCATION SECTOR IN INDIA
	- Growth in Government Expenditure on Education: on an average, the government spends less on tertiary education, 'expenditure per student' in
		tertiary education is higher than that of elementary
	- As we expand school education, we need more teachers who are trained in the higher educational institutions; therefore, expenditure on all levels
		of education should be increased.
	- In December 2002, the Government of India, through the 86th Amendment of the Constitution of India, made free and compulsory education a fundamental
		right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years.
	- The Tapas Majumdar Committee, appointed by the Government of India in 1998, estimated an expenditure of around Rs 1.37 lakh crores over 10 years 
		(1998-99 to 2006-07) to bring all Indian children in the age group of 6-14 years under the purview of school education.
	- In the Union Budget 2000-05, the Government of India levied a 2 per cent 'education cess' on all union taxes. The government estimated to get a 
		revenue of Rs 4,000-5,000 crores and the entire amount was earmarked for spending on elementary education.
	- Educational Achievements in India: educational achievements in a country are indicated in terms of adult literacy level, primary education
		completion rate and youth literacy rate.
		
# FUTURE PROSPECTS
	- Education for All — Still a Distant Dream: Though literacy rates for both — adults as well as youth — have increased, still the absolute number 
		of illiterates in India is as much as India’s population was at the time of independence.
	- Gender Equity — Better than Before: still the need to promote education for women in India is imminent for various reasons such as improving
		economic independence and social status of women and also because women education makes a favourable impact on fertility rate and health care
		of women and children.
	- Higher Education — a Few Takers: lesser and lesser number of people reaching the higher education level. The level of unemployment among educated
		youth is the highest.
	- the government should increase allocation for higher education and also improve the standard of higher education institutions, so that students are
		imparted employable skills in such institutions.
		
# CONCLUSION
	- The spread of education and health services across different sectors of society should be ensured so as to simultaneously attain economic
		growth and equity.
	- The concept of physical capital is the base for conceptualising human capital. There are some similarities as well as dissimilarities between the 
		two forms of capital formation.
	- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because only when people have the ability to
		read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, will they be able to make other choices which they value.		
		

-----------------------------	NCERT ECONOMY :: 11-6 RURAL DEVELOPMENT		-----------------------------
# INTRODUCTION
	- Mahatma Gandhi once said that the real progress of India did not mean simply the growth and expansion of industrial urban centres but mainly the
		development of the villages.
	- one-third of rural India still lives in abject poverty. That is the reason why we have to see a developed rural India if our nation has to realise 
		real progress.
		
# WHAT IS RURAL DEVELOPMENT?
	- initiatives for development in India includes Development of human resources including literacy, more specifically, female literacy, education 
		and skill development, health, addressing both sanitation and public health. Also Land reforms.
	- Infrastructure development like electricity, irrigation, credit, marketing, transport facilities including construction of village roads and feeder
		roads to nearby highways, facilities for agriculture research and extension, and information dissemination.
	- significant improvement in the living conditions of the weaker sections of the population emphasising access to productive employment opportunities.
	- farming communities have to be provided with various means that help them increase the productivity of grains, cereals, vegetables and fruits. Also
		need to be given opportunities to diversify into various non-farm productive activities such as food processing.
	- Giving them better and more affordable access to healthcare, sanitation facilities at workplaces and homes and education for all would be prioritised  
		for rapid rural development.

# CREDIT AND MARKETING IN RURAL AREAS
	- Credit:
	- The time gap between sowing the crop and selling in market is quite long, so farmers borrow money to meet their expense on investment.
	- In Independence era the farmers were in debt-trap by money lenders, so to overcome this issue social banking and multi-agency introduced to
		meet the need of rural credit.
	- National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was set up in 1982 as an apex body to coordinate the activities of all institutions 
		involved in the rural financing system. Also introduced Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), cooperatives and land development banks as multi-agency system 
		to dispense adequate credit at cheaper rates.
	- Self Help Group (SHG) have emerged
