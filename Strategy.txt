Plan for Preparation.

# Limited Resources:
  Keep your resources limited to whatever you can revise at the end. Please do not go for humongous books like Jain and   Mathur (World History) OR Tata Mc Graw Hill Complete GS (1000 page books) OR Huge volumes of Economy Books.

Also do not subscribe to multiple magazines or for that matter multiple newspapers.

Read only those resources that you may be able to revise at the end (say last 1 month). In order to revise a year’s material in last 1 month, make compressed notes.

# Mind Maps:
  In order to facilitate quick revision just before the exams, I made my notes in the format of mind maps. Mind Mapping is a great learning tool which helps to store information in our minds in a non-linear fashion facilitating easy retrieval. While depending upon linkages of different topics, it enhances retention.  It’s a tool worth exploring.
